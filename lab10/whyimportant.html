        <h1>Why is this standard important?</h1>
        <p>This web standard is important as it allows users all over the world to access and use the web. Without this web 
            standard, it would be much more complicated for users with different keyboard layouts, who speak different 
            languages, or people with disabilities to access websites. This standard has created a way to make sure that all 
            of these people can access a site and have the same experience as any other person would on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The web standard has made it easier for developers to develop a website that uses keyboard inputs as well. Without 
            this web standard, it would be much harder and more intricate for a developer to develop a site for a user with a 
            different keyboard layout, or without a mouse.
