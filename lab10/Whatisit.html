        <h1>What is the UI Events KeyboardEvents Standard?</h1>
        <p>
            The UI Events KeyboardEvents web standard makes a standard code for each key, using a QWERTY format. 
            It partitions the key codes into the different sections of the keyboard and creates a standard code or 
            key name for each individual key. This enables developers to use these key codes in their programs to 
            create a more universal functionality inside their programs, that is universal across all browsers as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            This standard uses the physical location of the key, instead of the key itself. If you use a German keyboard, and press the “ü” key, it will still list in the standard as a “[“ key. This is the 
            physical location of the key on the keyboard in the QWERTY layout, even if the end user is using a QWERTZ keyboard. The key press itself will show up as the key pressed, in this case a “ü”, but the 
            code will be a “[“ on the backend. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This development is beneficial to programmers and end users alike, as it creates universal functionality on sites, without sacrificing mistypes within the site when typing. A developer can make it so 
            that a certain key input on the keyboard, no matter the layout, has the same functionality within the site. The developer no longer has to create considerations for keyboard layouts when programming, 
            or detect the keyboard layout being used.
        </p>
