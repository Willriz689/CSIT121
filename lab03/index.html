                While I have learned a lot already, I believe that my favorite thing that I have learned is
                how to use GitHub. I previously had limited experience with github, and only knew the basics
                of uploading a file. I now know how to share a repository, and how to host a site through GitHub!
                I have also learned a lot more tags for HTML than I previously knew, as well as more resources to research from.

            <p class="center padding">
                In this project I have learned a lot about using CSS to adjust the positioning and style of the elements better.
                This includes changing the color of links, adding borders to the elements, and changing the color inside of the borders.
                I have also learned how to connect a style document to a HTML document.
