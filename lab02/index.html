                While I have learned a lot already, I believe that my favorite thing that I have learned is
                how to use GitHub. I previously had limited experience with github, and only knew the basics
                of uploading a file. I now know how to share a repository, and how to host a site through GitHub!
                I have also learned a lot more tags for HTML than I previously knew, as well as more resources to research from.
