            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>This lab is about the different types of media files that you may find on a website. This lab is also the first lab with multiple pages on one site. </p>
            <h2 class="spacer">What I learned</h2>
            <p>I learned in this lab what the SVG image type is. I also learned how to link other pages to the site so that you can visit other parts of the site. I also learned a lot in this
                lab throughout the CSS styling. I chose a different style from lab 3, and looked to challenge myself with how I styled the site. The navigation bar proved to be a challenge,
                having to research it thoroughly to get it to look the way I wanted to. In the end, I did my best with the fluidity from my knowledge without going too far ahead in the class,
                and I am happy with the results. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="spacer">What did I use?</h2>
            <p>
                In this lab I used W3Schools extensively for their tutorials in navigation bars, as well as their tutorials on styling the main tag and body. I used the freecodecamp site for the same thing,
                as it showed different ideas from W3Schools on how to create the navigation bar, as well as separate ideas on the styling of the site. I briefly used GitHub Copilot for it's autocomplete
                feature on VSCode through the extension.
