                Hello! My name is Will Rizzi. I'm a part-time student at CCBC and work full-time in IT. I am originally from North Carolina and moved up to Maryland two and a half years ago. I have a high-energy cat named Beignet who loves to play.

                I enjoy working out, especially weightlifting. When I'm not lifting, you'll usually find me reading or playing video games. Right now, I'm reading <i>God of the Woods</i> by Liz Moore and have just started a new <i>Dark Souls III</i> playthrough!
