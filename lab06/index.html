                <h2>MVA Website Evaluation</h2>

                <img src="mva picture.png" alt="Picture of MVA Homepage">
                <p class="picture-caption">Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration Homepage</p>

                <h4>What is the URL of the website?</h4>
                <p><a href="https://mva.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">https://mva.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx</a></p>

                <h4>What is the name of the website?</h4>
                <p>The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration</p>

                <h4>Who is the site's target audience?</h4>
                <p>Anyone in Maryland who is looking to do the paperwork for driving and car related things.</p>

                <h4>How is the site organized?</h4>
                <p>The site is organized using Hierarchal organization, as you select nav links to major site sections that go to different site services.</p>

                <h4>Which CRAP Design Principle does the site use? Provide at least one example.</h4>
                <p>The most prevalent CRAP principle that the MVA site uses is the alignment principle. All the icons for the different services are aligned very well, with it being easier to look at this way.</p>

                <h4>What is the Audit Score according to the <a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/">Accessibility Checker</a>?</h4>
                <p>The audit score according to accessibility checker is 59%</p>

                <h4>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h4>
                <p>The site is effective, as it supports users finding the service they need and completing what they need easily. They can do this as the pages that the user is looking for are labeled well, and are easy to find on the page.</p>

                <h4>What is the site's efficiency? Can users perform tasks quickly?</h4>
                <p>The site is efficient, as you can reach what most users are looking for in the site within three clicks within its hierarchical structure.</p>

                <h4>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h4>
                <p>The site is appropriate for its industry, as it is a government services website, so it was built with efficiency in mind, allowing you to streamline processes with the administration. While no motor vehicle site is “pleasant” to use, they make it as pain free as possible.</p>

                <h4>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h4>
                <p>My advice would be to make everything a bit more spaced out, as all of the information feels a bit crammed onto the front of the site, which makes it a bit harder to read and look for each individual item.</p>
