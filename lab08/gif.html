            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This GIF is from giphy, a popular site to get GIFs from for many purposes, from humor to information. The GIF above is Michael, from the office, doing finger guns at the camera.
            </p>
            <h3>File Type Info</h3>
            <p>The file type of the image above is GIF, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format. This format is commonly used for animated images, as it is popular in social media and online.
            </p>
            <h3>Why did I choose this image?</h3>
            <p>
                I chose this image as I watch The Office as a show for background noise a lot, as well as being obsessed with it when I was younger. When seeing GIF as a format option, there
                are so many GIFs from the office that it was the first thing that I had thought of.
