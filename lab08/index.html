            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this lab is to use Javascript to create a custom navigation bar for the lab04 website.</p>
            <h2 class="spacer">What I learned</h2>
            <p>
                I learned all about using Javascript for site functions, as well as how to create navigation bars using a div. I had trouble attempting
                to create the navigation bar, and keep it even when the links were hidden. This project was very insightful and challenged me to better
                my own previous programming, with new learned skills. In this project, I used the W3Schools responsive top navigation. I wanted
                to put my own spin on it, and make it collapsable all the time, instead of just in the mobile configuration. This took some playing around with, but I eventually got it.
